    <h1>This site is a step by step <a href="welcome.html">prototype guide</a> for employment.</h1>

    <p>This prototype will be designed with case managers and job seekers to meet job seeker needs of guidance and support for navigating public services during critical periods of unemployment. And model how to create simpler, user-centered multi-persona roadmaps.</p>

    <p>This is a template that local employment specialist and case managers can use to customize for their independent job seeker to do list. It is not a real application: <strong>no data entered on these pages will be shared or stored</strong>.</p>

    <h2>Background</h2>

    <p class="usa-font-lead">Building on the work of Workforce Development modernization, <a href="https://www.codeforamerica.org" target="_blank">Code for America</a> and the <a href="https://www.muni.org/departments/employee_relations/pages/jol.aspx" target="_blank">Municipality of Anchorage</a> have been working to use the tools of technology and design to <strong>improve how the hardest to reach job seekers get access to critical services and resources for successful re-entry into the workforce.</strong></p>

    <p>Our team began by exploring the current state of job seeker services and delivery across local city job centers and nonprofits in an extensive qualitative user research field study. <a href="{{ base }}assets/discovery-findings-mapping-enrollment-Nov2016.pdf">See the report of our findings</a>.</p>

    <p>From here, our team began working closely with local case managers to identify tools to help accelerate their service delivery modernization efforts. </p>

    <h2>About this prototype</h2>

    <p class="usa-font-lead">This prototype demonstrates a user-centered enrollment model that leverages data sharing between agencies and case managers to <strong>minimize the burden on applicants in determining program eligibility and accessing governmental services in their journey of re-entry and re-employment</strong>.</p>

    <p>In our research, we saw a common need from job seekers for guidance on overcoming personal challenges to re-employment. This was validated by a common tasks provided by servicers to refer non-eligible clients to an independent search of navigating public services and resources through inconsistent means. Thus, an online roadmap template which offices can customize to meet the needs of independent job seeker clients has been viewed as a desired solution through initial rounds of testing.</p>

    <p>The alpha version of the prototype is designed to model how one or more applicants can use the tailored roadmap to guide them on the necessary things to do to become job-ready; particularly for re-entrants with low level computer skills.</p>

    <h2>What does “alpha” mean?</h2>
    <p class="usa-font-lead">The alpha stage of product development is a short phase after a deep discovery in which teams <strong>quickly design, build, and test concepts with users</strong>.</p>
    <p>The aim of the alpha phase is to:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Show that project is technically feasible</li>
      <li>Build and test early versions of a product with real users</li>
      <li>Gather feedback from stakeholders and key partners to identify improvements for a beta release</li>
    </ol>
    <p>In other words: this prototype is a work-in-progress... and we want your help making it better.</p>
